<!-- Currently static content, but should evolve into dynamic content populated by a MedBus service catalog. -->

The following data services have been developed and deployed as part of the MedBus suite of web services.

### Attestation

The purpose of the attestation service is to develop the beginnings of a framework for connecting users to ePHI data resources is a manner that is compliant with their existing [IRB](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/institutional-review-boards) data access authorizations and training requirements. Currently this service provides an aggregate view of training courses and their status across multiple training data providers (MyLINC and MLearnig).

Data Sources: MedBus Training, MedBus IRB Approved Studies

### Training

Given a UMHS user ID ([uniqname](https://infoglossary.med.umich.edu/index.php/Uniqname)) as input, this service identifies training that the user has completed in order to meet [instituional requirements](http://my.research.umich.edu/peerrs/) for handling protected data as well as any training required to access an individual application such as [DataDirect](http://datadirect.med.umich.edu) or [EMERSE](http://project-emerse.org/).

Data Sources: [MyLINC](http://www.mais.umich.edu/training/maislinc_overview.html), [MLearning](https://mlearning.med.umich.edu)

### IRB Approved Studies

Given a UMHS user ID ([uniqname](https://infoglossary.med.umich.edu/index.php/Uniqname)) as input, this service identifies the current set of active HUM IDs that a researcher can access protected data under, and reports the specific protected data domains that a user can access data from within the context of those studies. This web services reports on data housed in the [eResearch Human Subjects](http://www.mais.umich.edu/reporting/eresdataset.html) data warehouse which reports on data extracted nightly from the University of Michigan's [eResearch electronic research administration](http://eresearch.umich.edu/). This service is currently being tested to be used by [DataDirect](http://datadirect.med.umich.edu).

Data Source: [UM Data Warehouse: eResearch Human Subjects](http://umms-ckan.umms.med.umich.edu/ckan/dataset/human_subjects_research__eresearch__um_data_warehouse)

### Waveform

The waveform service queries waveform recording metadata from a collection of waveform BLOBs generated by digital physiological monitoring equipment in care units within the University of Michigan Health System. These data include monitoring equipment variables such as EKG I-IV, Pulmonary Artery Pressure, CVP, SpO2 and other variables recorded from multiple units in the health system. Queries against this web service are made available to researchers via the Waveform Panel in the [DataDirect](http://datadirect.med.umich.edu) application.

### Biorepository

The biorepository service allows for queries against biospecimens that are housed in the [UMHS central biorepository](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/biorepository) in order to identify specimens that are available for secondary use for research. This services queries a reporting environment extracted from the UMHS instance of the [LabVantage](http://www.labvantage.com/) LIMS. Queries against this resource are made available to researchers via the Biorepository panel of the [DataDirect](http://datadirect.med.umich.edu) application, and access to these specimens are governed by [a formal specimen use proposal to the biorepository](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/biorepository/specimen-use-proposals).
