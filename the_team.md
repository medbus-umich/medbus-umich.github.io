### MSIS Research IT Program

MedBus development is being led by the Medical School Information Services (MSIS) Research IT program. The MSIS Research IT program drives the deployment of information technology services that enable research for the University of Michigan Medical School. The MedBus Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) contributes to our strategic goal of building and deploying federated data integration services.

MedBus is being supported across MSIS groups with contributions from the Software Delivery group, Data Management Services and with operational support from Services Delivery. MedBus web services are being constructed in collaboration with service consumers including Data Office for Clinical and Translational Research.
