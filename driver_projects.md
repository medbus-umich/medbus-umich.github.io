## Self-Serve Research Data Access

The selection of data sources being made available as MedBus services has been driven by ongoing efforts to increase the capabilities of self-serve data access tools for [UMHS](http://www.med.umich.edu/) clinical and translational research. These self-serve tools allow researchers to quickly identify potential cohorts of patients that could be enrolled in research studies, and to identify the available data and biosample resources for translational research. This work is being conducted in partnership with the [Data Office for Clinical and Translational Research](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/honest-broker-office).

MedBus services such as the [biospecimen service](http://#) and [waveform service](http://#) allow for researchers to identify resources that may already be available for potential study participants. The development of these data interfaces as web services allow for federated data access to these resources regardless of the underlying location of these data. The development of an [attestation service](http://#) and [training service](http://#) provide the data to ensure that individuals accessing these data are doing so in a manner that is compliant with research projects that have been approved by the [Institutional Review Board](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/institutional-review-boards), and that they have completed the mandatory training required for access to ePHI data.

Additional information on how to access to these self-serve data tools are available through the [UMHS Honest Broker Office](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/honest-broker-office/self-serve-data-tools).

## NIH FAIR Data Mandates

MedBus services are aligned to [NIH FAIR principles](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/NIH-Public-Access-Plan.pdf) of developing a [data commons infrastructure](https://datascience.nih.gov/commons) in which research data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Our infrastructure for UMHS research data services will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of research within UMHS, and will further enable researchers to meet the data sharing requirements of publicly funded research.
