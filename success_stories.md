### Integrating Biospecimen Availability with Donor Health Record Data

A database of over XXXX biospecimens available for research has been developed and curated by the [UMHS central biorepository](https://www.michr.umich.edu/services/biorepository). However this biorepostory database does not contain the full set of phenotypic information that is available in the electronic medical record of the donor. We have developed a biospecimen service that allows for the availability of specimens to be searched in the context of the EHR phenotypic data available in [DataDirect](https://datadirect.med.umich.edu/) so that researchers can do cohort searches that combined EHR data with available biospecimens.

**Collaborating Partners:** Integrating these data involved the successful collaboration of the [UMMS Central Biorepository unit](https://www.michr.umich.edu/services/biorepository), the [MSIS](http://msis.med.umich.edu/) LabVantage Support team, and the [DOCTR team](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/data-office-clinical-and-translational-research) developing the [DataDirect](https://datadirect.med.umich.edu/) application.

### Consolodating Distributed Training Certifications

University sponsored training of personnel can take place across multple venues, and the digital certifications resulting from this training are stored in multple data systems within the university. We have developed a training certification web service that allows applications to search against a single source to determine relevant training certification status of individual users. This service has been designed to be reusable by allowing individual applications to tune this service to provide only the training data that is relevant to their specific requirements. To date this service integrates training from [ITS](http://www.itcs.umich.edu/) training data provided by [MyLINC](http://www.mais.umich.edu/training/maislinc_overview.html) and UMHS training data stored in [MLearning](http://mlearning.med.umich.edu).

**Collaborating Partners:** The successful completion of this project involved collaborators from the ITS [MyLINC](https://maislinc.umich.edu/maislinc/learner/home/index?FromLogin=1) data warehouse group, the MSIS [MLearning group](http://msis.med.umich.edu/things-you-might-need/mlearning), and the [DOCTR team](http://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/research/office-research/data-office-clinical-and-translational-research) developing the [DataDirect](https://datadirect.med.umich.edu/) application.
