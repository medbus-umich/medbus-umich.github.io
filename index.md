"We are at a point in history where Big Data should not intimidate, but inspire us. We are in the midst of a revolution that is transforming the way we do biomedical research. In some cases, rather than posing a question, designing experiments to answer that question, and then gathering data, we already have the needed data in hand—we just have to devise creative ways to sift through this mountain of data and make sense of it." -- Francis Collins, http://directorsblog.nih.gov/2014/05/06/mining-the-big-data-mountain/





"Big Data represents the emergence of the digital enterprise—the ability for an organization to take full advantage of its digital assets."
"Becoming a Digital Enterprise represents a challenge for many institutions since their organizational structures make widespread data integration and analysis difficult"
"thanks to the Digital Enterprise, pooled knowledge can lead to a distinct advantage"

"Your task is not to foresee the future, but to enable it."
Citadelle or The Wisdom of the Sands (1948)



"It's not enough to just put the data out there. Its really about being fair and by that I mean you have got to be able to find the data, access it, interoperate and reuse it."
